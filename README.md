# Fake-News-Detection

Title: Fake News Detection
Description: This project contains the code that checks the different news articles and classifies them as Real or Fake.

The project explores the use of PySpark in effectively detecting fake news and therefore, it compares the accuracy of PassiveAggresive Classifier and Gradient Boosted Trees or GBT Classifier using PySpark

The only challenge I faced was computational. You will see in the code that not many iterations were conducted to improve the accuracy. I didn't have enough computing power on my laptop so I didn't refine the accuracy.

Using/Credits: Please feel free to clone the code and give the credits if you wish to use the code.
